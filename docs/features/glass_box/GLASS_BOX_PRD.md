### **1. Overview & Introduction**

The SDLC Agent Workflow is positioned to revolutionize development velocity by automating document creation. However, user adoption is critically dependent on trust. This document outlines the requirements for the **"Glass Box" Traceability Feature**, a foundational initiative designed to solve the "AI trust gap."

The vision is to transform the AI from an opaque "black box" into a transparent and trusted collaborator. We will achieve this by creating a system where every key statement generated by the AI is programmatically linked back to its source material, allowing for instant, one-click verification. This feature will be our primary differentiator in a market of untrustworthy AI tools.

### **2. Problem Statement**

> AI-powered document generation tools promise to accelerate the SDLC, but they currently operate without visibility into their reasoning. This opacity creates a critical **"trust gap."** Development teams cannot blindly accept the AI's output for high-stakes documents, as a single subtle error can lead to significant downstream costs, delays, and technical debt.
>
> Consequently, engineers are forced to pay a **"trust tax":** they must spend an excessive amount of time manually cross-referencing the generated document against the source material to verify its accuracy. This tedious, manual verification process erodes the very efficiency the AI was meant to provide and undermines user confidence in our platform.

### **3. Target Audience & Persona**

Our primary target user is **"Maria," the Senior Software Engineer.**

- **Role:** Senior Software Engineer or Tech Lead (8+ years experience).
- **Mindset:** Pragmatically optimistic about AI. Eager to offload tedious work but deeply skeptical of letting an AI make critical decisions without oversight. Her guiding principle is **"Trust, but verify."**
- **Goals:** Reduce time spent on documentation, ensure technical plans are robust, and prevent costly rework by catching errors early.
- **Pain Points:** She loses productivity by double-checking the AI's work, worries about missing subtle AI errors, and will abandon tools that require more "babysitting" than they are worth.

### **4. Goals & Objectives**

This feature aims to achieve the following goals:

| Goal Type | Goal | How it will be Achieved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Goal** | **Increase Confidence & Trust** | By providing a direct, one-click way to see the source of any AI-generated claim. |
| **User Goal** | **Increase Review Velocity** | By eliminating the need for manual, side-by-side document comparison. |
| **Business Goal** | **Drive Feature Adoption & Retention** | By making the AI agent a genuinely useful and trustworthy tool, preventing user churn. |
| **Business Goal**| **Establish a Competitive Differentiator** | By positioning our platform as the most transparent and verifiable AI SDLC tool on the market. |

### **5. User Stories**

- **As a** Senior Engineer, **I want to** see the exact source text that an AI-generated statement is based on, **so that** I can quickly verify its accuracy without re-reading the entire source document.
- **As a** Senior Engineer, **I want** the source links to be unobtrusive and integrated into the document, **so that** my reading flow isn't interrupted unless I choose to perform a verification.
- **As a** Senior Engineer, **when I** click a source link, **I want to** be taken directly to the highlighted text in the source document, **so that** I don't have to waste time searching for the relevant context.

### **6. Functional Requirements (FR)**

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FR1** | **Source-Linking** | The system must be able to programmatically map sections of the generated document back to the specific source paragraphs used as context for their creation. |
| **FR2** | **Visual Indicators** | The UI must display a discrete, non-intrusive icon (`ðŸ”—`) next to each AI-generated section that has a traceable source. |
| **FR3** | **On-Demand Verification** | Clicking the traceability icon must trigger a modal or side-panel view that displays the content of the original source document. |
| **FR4** | **Automatic Highlighting** | Upon displaying the source document, the system must automatically scroll to and apply a clear visual highlight to the relevant source paragraph(s). |
| **FR5** | **API Support** | The backend API must return a structured JSON object containing the chunked source document, the chunked generated document, and the traceability map linking them. |

### **7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NFR1**| **Performance** | The source verification modal must load and display the highlighted content in **under 500ms** to feel instantaneous. |
| **NFR2**| **Usability** | The feature must be intuitive and discoverable. The meaning and function of the traceability icon should be self-evident. |
| **NFR3**| **Reliability** | The traceability mapping must be accurate and relevant in **>95%** of cases. The highlighted source must logically correspond to the generated text. |

### **8. UI/UX & Design**

The user interface will adhere to the approved mockups, which detail the visual design of the document view, the traceability icon (including hover states), and the source-link modal. The design prioritizes a clean, uncluttered reading experience with verification tools that are present but not intrusive.

### **9. Success Metrics (To be measured 1 month post-launch)**

- **Primary Metric (Adoption):**
  - **Traceability Interaction Rate > 70%:** At least 70% of generated documents have at least one traceability link clicked, indicating users are actively using and valuing the feature.
- **Secondary Metrics (Impact):**
  - **User Confidence Score (4.5/5):** Achieve an average user-reported confidence score of 4.5 or higher on a 1-5 scale.
  - **Time-to-Approval (-25%):** Reduce the average time from document generation to user "approval" by 25%, indicating faster, more confident reviews.
- **Qualitative Metric:**
  - Positive user feedback in interviews, with phrases like "I trust this now" or "This saves me so much time."

### **10. Out of Scope for this Release (MVP)**

To ensure a focused and timely launch, the following features are explicitly out of scope for this version:
- User ability to edit, correct, or create their own traceability links.
- Displaying an AI-generated "confidence score" for each section.
- Sentence-level traceability (the MVP will be at the paragraph/section level).
- A conversational, back-and-forth generation process.

### **11. Assumptions & Dependencies**

- **Assumption:** Source documents are text-based (e.g., Markdown).
- **Assumption:** Paragraph-level chunking is sufficient for meaningful traceability in the MVP.
- **Dependency:** The feature requires a stable, production-level API from a third-party LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI). Performance and cost are dependent on this external service.
