## 1. Summary

### 1.1. Feature Overview
This feature introduces a native audio recording capability directly within the SDLC Agent Workflow application. It allows users to capture audio from their microphone, save it as a standard MP3 file, and automatically load it into the transcription workflow.

### 1.2. Problem Solved
Currently, users must record audio using external applications and then manually upload the resulting file. This creates friction and a disconnect between the real-world conversation (e.g., a project meeting) and the start of the automated SDLC process.

### 1.3. Value Proposition
By integrating recording directly into the application, we:
- **Streamline the Workflow**: Bridge the gap between live discussions and AI-powered analysis.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Provide a seamless, all-in-one interface.
- **Increase Automation**: Eliminate the manual steps of recording, saving, and uploading audio files.

## 2. User Workflow (MVP)

The user experience for the Minimum Viable Product will be as follows:

1.  **Navigate to UI**: The user opens the Gradio application.
2.  **Locate Recorder**: A new UI section titled **"Record Audio"** is visible alongside the existing file upload options.
3.  **Start Recording**: The user clicks the **"Start Recording"** button.
    - The button's text changes to **"Stop Recording"**.
    - A status indicator displays "Status: Recording..." along with a running timer (e.g., `00:01`, `00:02`).
4.  **Capture Audio**: The application records audio from the user's default system microphone.
5.  **Stop Recording**: The user clicks the **"Stop Recording"** button.
    - The recording is immediately finalized and saved.
    - The button reverts to **"Start Recording"**, and the status indicator shows "Status: Saved `recording_2025-07-23_103000.mp3`".
    - The file path of the newly created recording is **automatically populated** into the file input field of the transcription tool.
6.  **Proceed with Workflow**: The user can now click the existing "Generate PRD" or "Transcribe" button to process the recorded audio without any further manual steps.

## 3. UI/UX Design

### 3.1. New UI Components
- **Section**: A `Gradio.Box` or `Gradio.Group` titled "Record Audio".
- **Button**: A `Gradio.Button` that toggles between "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording".
- **Status Indicator**: A `Gradio.Textbox` or `Gradio.Markdown` element to display the recording status and timer.

## 4. Technical Design & Implementation

### 4.1. New Service: `recording_service.py`
- A new service will be created at `services/recording_service.py`.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Manage the audio recording stream.
    - Handle WAV-to-MP3 file conversion.
    - Manage file naming and saving to the `recordings/` directory.
- **Threading Model**: The recording process must run in a background thread (`threading.Thread`) to prevent the Gradio UI from freezing. The service will use an event flag to signal when to stop recording.

### 4.2. New Dependencies
The `pyproject.toml` file will be updated to include:
- `sounddevice`: For capturing audio from the microphone.
- `scipy`: For writing the captured NumPy array to a WAV file.
- `pydub`: For converting the WAV file to MP3.

A system-level dependency on **`ffmpeg`** will be required for `pydub` to function.

### 4.3. File Handling
- A new directory, `recordings/`, will be created at the project root to store all recorded audio files.
- This directory should be added to the `.gitignore` file.
- **File Naming Convention**: `recording_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.mp3`. This ensures unique, sortable filenames.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

The following features are considered out of scope for v1.0 but are planned for future iterations:

- **[ ] Pause and Resume**: Allow users to pause recording without terminating the session.
- **[ ] Input Device Selection**: A dropdown menu to select the audio input device.
- **[ ] Scheduled Recordings**: Integration with calendar events to trigger recordings automatically.
- **[ ] System Audio Capture**: Record the system's output audio (e.g., from a video call), which is a more complex, OS-specific task.
- **[ ] Automatic Silence Trimming**: Post-process the audio to remove dead air, optimizing the subsequent transcription.
