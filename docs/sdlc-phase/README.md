### **Corrected Workflow: From Concept to Customer and Back Again**

**Discovery -> Ideation -> Planning & Refinement -> Technical Design -> Development -> Release -> Monitor & Iterate**

This is a cycle, not a straight line. The insights from the final phase feed back into the first.

---

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Research**

**Core Question:** *What problem should we solve and why does it matter?*

This is the foundation. You don't start with ideas; you start with problems. If you skip this, you risk building something nobody needs.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Market Research:** What are competitors doing? What are the market trends?
    *   **User Research:** Conducting user interviews, sending out surveys.
    *   **Data Analysis:** Analyzing user behavior data, looking at drop-off points in funnels.
    *   **Feedback Review:** Reviewing customer support tickets, sales team feedback, and app store reviews.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A validated **Problem Statement**.
    *   A **Business Case** or Opportunity Assessment document.
*   **Who's Involved:** Product Managers, UX Researchers, Data Analysts, Business Stakeholders.

### **Phase 2: Ideation & Concept Definition**

**Core Question:** *How might we solve this problem? What is the best approach?*

This is the creative phase where you explore potential solutions. It includes brainstorming as a key activity.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Brainstorming Sessions:** Generating a wide quantity of raw ideas (as per our template).
    *   **Sketching & Storyboarding:** Creating low-fidelity visuals of the potential user journey.
    *   **Prototyping:** Building simple wireframes or interactive mockups.
    *   **Concept Validation:** Showing prototypes to users to get early feedback.
    *   **Solution Selection:** Using tools like an Impact/Effort matrix to select the most promising solution.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A validated **Feature Concept**.
    *   A high-level **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.
    *   User Journeys, Wireframes, and high-fidelity Mockups.
*   **Who's Involved:** Product Managers, UX/UI Designers, Lead Engineers, key stakeholders.

### **Phase 3: Planning & Backlog Refinement (Product Grooming)**

**Core Question:** *What exactly do we need to build for the first version (MVP)?*

This is where you translate the high-level concept into detailed, actionable work items for the development team.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Writing User Stories:** Breaking the feature down into small, specific user-centric requirements.
    *   **Defining Acceptance Criteria:** For each story, defining the exact conditions that must be met for it to be considered "done."
    *   **Prioritization:** Ranking the user stories (e.g., using MoSCoW method - Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
    *   **Effort Estimation:** The engineering team provides rough estimates (e.g., story points) for the work.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A well-defined and prioritized **Product Backlog** for the feature.
    *   A finalized PRD for the MVP.
*   **Who's Involved:** Product Manager, Engineering Team (including QA).

### **Phase 4: Technical Design & Grooming**

**Core Question:** *How will we technically build this feature in a scalable and secure way?*

Before writing code, the engineering team needs a blueprint.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **System Architecture Design:** Creating diagrams of how the components will interact.
    *   **API Contract Definition:** Defining the exact requests and responses for backend endpoints.
    *   **Database Schema Design:** Planning any new database tables or changes.
    *   **Technology Selection:** Choosing specific libraries or frameworks needed.
    *   **Task Breakdown:** Breaking user stories down into technical sub-tasks.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A **Technical Requirements Document (TRD)** or Technical Design Document.
    *   A populated engineering task board (e.g., in Jira or Azure DevOps).
*   **Who's Involved:** Lead Engineers, Senior Engineers, DevOps/SRE, Security Team.

### **Phase 5: Development & Continuous Testing**

**Core Question:** *Are we building the feature correctly and to a high standard?*

This is the "building" phase. In modern agile practices, development and testing are not sequential; they happen in parallel within each sprint.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Writing Code:** The core development work.
    *   **Writing Unit & Integration Tests:** Developers write tests to verify their code works as expected.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Peers review each other's code for quality, correctness, and adherence to standards.
    *   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated builds and tests run every time code is committed.
    *   **Manual & Exploratory Testing:** QA engineers test the feature from a user's perspective, looking for bugs and usability issues.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A feature-complete, tested, and "potentially shippable" increment of software.
*   **Who's Involved:** Developers, QA Engineers.

### **Phase 6: Release & Launch**

**Core Question:** *How do we get this feature to our users safely and effectively?*

This is the process of deploying the code and launching the feature to customers.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Final Regression Testing:** QA ensures that the new feature hasn't broken any existing functionality.
    *   **Deployment to Production:** The code is pushed to the live servers.
    *   **Release Strategy:** Deciding how to launch. Options include:
        *   **Full Launch:** Everyone gets it at once.
        *   **Canary Release:** Release to a small percentage of users first (e.g., 1%).
        *   **Feature Flag:** Deploy the code but keep the feature hidden, then turn it on for specific users or groups.
    *   **Internal Training:** Preparing customer support and marketing teams.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   The feature is live and available to customers.
    *   Launch communication (blog posts, emails, etc.).
*   **Who's Involved:** DevOps/SRE, QA, Product Manager, Marketing, Customer Support.

### **Phase 7: Monitor, Learn & Iterate**

**Core Question:** *Did we solve the original problem? What should we do next?*

The work isn't done when the feature is launched. This phase is what makes the process a continuous loop of improvement.

*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Monitoring Analytics:** Tracking the success metrics defined in Phase 1 (e.g., adoption rate, login times).
    *   **Gathering User Feedback:** Actively collecting feedback via surveys, support channels, and reviews.
    *   **Bug Fixing:** Prioritizing and fixing any issues that arise post-launch.
    *   **Analysis & Reporting:** Analyzing the data to determine the feature's impact and sharing the results with stakeholders.
*   **Primary Output:**
    *   A list of validated learnings and insights.
    *   A backlog of bug fixes and potential improvements for the next version (v2).
    *   This output feeds directly back into **Phase 1: Discovery** for the next iteration.
*   **Who's Involved:** Product Manager, Data Analysts, Customer Support, Engineering Team.
