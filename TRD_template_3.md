## 8. Technical Requirements
*   The application must support Android API level [Number] ([Name]) and above.
*   The application must follow [e.g., Material Design] guidelines.
*   The code must be written in [Language] and follow the official style guide.
*   [Add other requirements, e.g., security standards.]

## 9. Complexity Weight Classification
*   **Very Low (1-2 SP):** Simple UI changes, bug fixes.
    *   **Classification:** Tasks that can be completed within a few hours and have minimal impact on other parts of the application.
*   **Low (3-5 SP):** Simple feature development, basic API integration.
    *   **Classification:** Tasks that involve creating new components or screens with straightforward logic.
*   **Medium (6-8 SP):** Complex feature development, third-party library integration.
    *   **Classification:** Tasks that require significant effort, involve multiple components, or depend on external libraries.
*   **High (>8 SP):** Very complex features, major architectural changes.
    *   **Classification:** Tasks that are critical to the application, require extensive research and development, and may impact the overall architecture.
